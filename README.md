#  How to use this file
We ask that all students working on their Bachelor or Master projects / theses has to hand in the source code and a project documentation. 
Source coude (including architecture and comments) has to adhere to our [developer guidelines](https://isgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/STUD/pages/1409184/Developer+Guidelines). 
The project documentation has to consist of a `README.md` file (optionally also more `.md` files or if useful) that contains the following information. 
Thus, copy this file's content as a template in your own project and revise it with your project's information. 

Besides using the following template, also check out the following sources to see some examples or read further useful information on how to write a good `README.md` for your project. Note that the exemplary projects do not 100% follow this template (either because they are created by third-parties or were created before we consolidated all the information into this template) but are still examples of good `README.md` files.
